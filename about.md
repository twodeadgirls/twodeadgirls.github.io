<strong>In the summer of 1999 two high school students</strong>, one on her seventeenth birthday, were brutally murdered and left in A car trunk in downtown Ozark Alabama. For over 19 years the case remained unsolved fueling rumours and conspiracy theories of a police cover-up. In 2017 a reserve police officer claimed a former officer was responsible. The Attorney General then appointed a special cold case investigator and pushed for DNA recovered from a victim to be compared to a national geneological database. Parallel to this development a retired state law enforcement official that had quietly worked the case for years shared documents that were never shared with the FBI supporting the officer's claim. These documents were not shared with the grand jury who later indicted a man who had consensual sex with one of the victims earlier that evening.
    This case is a rare behind the scenes look at a cold case homicide investigation that exposes how the U.S. Justice system is mis-using DNA evidence to convict the innocent.

    <strong>EPISODE 1:  THE TIMELINE </strong> <br> From 8 PM July 31, 1999 until 9:02 AM Aug 1, the movements of these two girls are documented by phone records, witness, police sightings and security video.

     <strong>EPISODE 2:  EVIDENCE </strong> <br> Evidence is in three catagores, physical, circumstantial and inferential. One victim had semen dna fragments recovered that matched to Coley Mccraney's DNA, however the autopsy indicated no sign of sexual assault and witnesses were aware of a relationship between the two. Dozens of items were recovered from the car but no prints or dna were obtained from the 13 spent cartridges recovered from the trunk. Left on Beasley's thigh (pictured above) was a single 9mm unspent round. Many believe this was purposeful along with where the car was placed in downtown Ozark had meaning to explain the crime. Both girls were as well wet and had mud on them from the waist down. We examine all known evidence and eyewitnesses coming forward that have not been shared with the public. <p>

  <strong>EPISODE 3:  THE SUSPECTS </strong> <br> In this case unfortunately DNA evidence from a consensual sexual encounter was mistakenly used for 19 years to exclude persons of interest and suspects. Nearly 200 people were tested and the city spending nearly one million dollars according to former Chief Tony Spivey. But by not pursuing leads that involved suspects excluded because of DNA not matching, these means that the potential party responsoble was cleared. The original suspects now are re-examined and put into the context of the new information and witnesses that have come forward. <p>

Beasley was rumuored to have a tape of incriminating information on seevral pro9nent individuals and was scheduled to be a witness in a court the following week.
