<strong>Statement</strong>
<p> Multidisciplinary visual artist and rancher.
  <p>
  I use photography to document how landscapes influence social judgment, motivation, and behavior. This includes still images, video and drawings which offers understanding how physical form influences social goals and political attitudes by the underlying repetitive physical-level experience.
  Interested in researching ethnically segregated communities by investigating interactions between urban form (e.g., emotion, social cognition, motivation, attitudes, and belief systems) and effects on social behavior (e.g., persuasion, communication, decision making, stereotyping, political behavior, hate crimes and intergroup cooperation or conflict). 
  <p>I'm a self-taught photographer, introduced to the medium while in graduate school and studying the works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Jackson">J.B. Jackson</a>. Drawing and graphic skills honed @ Auburn University's School of Architecture while obtaining an degree in architecture.

<strong>Equipment</strong> 
 <p>Equipment used is a Fuji XPro2 (stills) and XT-3 (video) along with <a href="https://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x-lenses/">their fixed x series lenses- 16/23/35/56</a>. Fuji’s system is small weatherproof and very durable. It's sensor captures a gorgeous spectrum of color.  
   Seasonally I work as a mountain guide<a href="https://www.sanjuanbackcountry.com"> (click to book a trip) </a> in the wilderness of the San Juan mountains of Colorado between 10 and 14 thousand feet in elevation so my camera must fit in a backpack, be lightweight and work in any weather condition. 
Digitally I keep things minimal using an iPad pro, editing kept to a minimum. With the iPad I've found I can use open source software, Jekyll and Github to maintain this page to record my ideas. The core idea is mobile and self reliant, not needing electricity except what a backpack based solar unit can provide and avoid the use of a laptop or desktop. If I can't do all I need to do on the hood of my truck then it does'nt work.
